# Privacy Policy for Wakt – Muslim Prayer Times

Last Updated: December 25, 2025

Wakt is a privacy‑friendly, local‑first app that helps you determine daily prayer times and Qibla direction. This policy explains what information the app uses and how it is handled.

## Information We Collect and Use
- **Location (approximate or precise, device sensor)**
  - Purpose: Calculate prayer times for your area and show Qibla direction.
  - Control: You can deny location permission and manually select a city.
  - Retention: Stored on your device settings only; not uploaded.
- **Network requests (geocoding/fonts)**
  - Purpose: Optional geocoding (find location from city name) and first‑run font download/caching.
  - Data sent: City search term to public geocoding service; no personal identifiers.
  - Retention: Fonts cached locally; geocoding results used transiently.

## Data Storage
- Settings (location, preferences, fonts) are stored on your device.
- Wakt does not create a user account, cloud backup, or server profile.

## Data Sharing and Sale
- Wakt does **not share**, sell, or transfer your data to third parties.
- No analytics SDKs, ads SDKs, or tracking beacons are used.

## Permissions
- **Location**: For prayer times and Qibla compass.
- **Notifications**: To deliver Adhan reminders at prayer times.
- **Exact alarms** (Android): To schedule Adhan on time.
- **Internet**: For optional geocoding and initial font caching.

## Children’s Privacy
- Suitable for general audiences. No accounts, chat, or social features.

## Security
- All external requests use HTTPS.
- Local data is stored using platform‑standard mechanisms.

## Changes
We may update this policy for clarity or new features. Material changes will be noted in‑app or here.
